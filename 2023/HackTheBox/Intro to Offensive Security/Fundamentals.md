# Pentesting Fundamentals

## Ethics

A penetration test involves formal document called **Rules of Engagement** that outlines permission, scope (systems to be tested), and rules (techniques, tools). Pentesting companies have to follow legal frameworks.

## Stages

1. Information Gathering
2. Enumeration / Scanning
3. Exploitation
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Post-Exploitation
   1. At the end of testing, you will have to remove any artifacts that has been created as a result of your testing.

There are a few different testing methodologies, including:

* **The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)**: Provide framework for testing strategies of networks and *telecommunications* (phone, VoIP, etc.) systems 
* **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)**: Provideframework for security of web applications and services.
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1**: For organization security and management of risk threats.
* **Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF)**: Framework of fourteen principles used to assess risk of cybe rthreats.

## Types of Testing

1. Black-box
2. Grey-box: **Most popular**
3. White-box: Access to all source code

## Principles of Security

* **CIA Triad**: Covers *Confidentiality*, *Integrity*, *Availability*. It is a continuous cycle; if one element is not met, then the other two are rendered useless. It highlights the importance of protecting data away from unwanted eyes (confidentiality), ensuring data is not improperly tampered (integrity), and that it is available for users (availability)
