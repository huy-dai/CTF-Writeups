# Red Team Engagements

## Objectives and Scope

**Objectives** set the tone for the rest of engagement, so it should be clearly discussed and communicated between the client and red team. Engagements can be general penetration test or emulating a specific type of adversary.

**Scope** defines what you *cannot* or *can* target, and is set only by the client. Examples include:

- No exfiltration of data
- Production servers are off-limits
- x.x.x.x/20 is out of scope
- System downtime is not permitted under any circumstances

These parts are incorporated into the **Rules of Engagement (RoE)**, which are a legally binding outline of the engagement that acts as the general contract between client and red team.

It adds on details like Purpose, Technical Expectations, Ground Rules, Authorization, Points of Contact.
