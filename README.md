# general_ctf_2021
My solutions for various CTF competitions that I participate in 2021, including some training wargames and archived CTF challenges.

Note: Many of the included binaries in this git repo is inherently unsecure (since they are posted as pwn challenges), which explains why there are Github warnings about potential repo vulnerabilities.
