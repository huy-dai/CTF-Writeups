# Tools that I use

These are the different tools and packages that I've used to solve least one CTF challenge. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list and was started by me in January 23rd, 2022 to document interesting tools that I come across during CTF competitions:


| Name | Category | Usage | Installation | Chall |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Autopsy & Sleuthkit | Forensics | Autopsy is the GUI implementation of Sleuthkit, both of which are used for analyzing disk images and recovering files from them | sudo apt-get install autopsy sleuthkit | PicoGym Forensics - Disk, Disk, Sleuth! |
